# Chess App Case

## Problem definition

The chess app project is aimed at using innovative technologies to improve the way we play chess on our phones. It is supposed to connect to David's backend, but this will not be necessary for me to get a proper working app.

## Opportunities

- Location based chess: Use GPS capabilities to enable location-based chess matches, allowing players to challenge opponents in their vicinity.
- Physical to virtual conversion: Enable the app to recognise physical chess boards and pieces through the smartphone camera, offering opportunities for real-world interaction.
- Multiplayer on the Go: Facilitate quick and easy multiplayer chess matches by leveraging mobile connectivity and peer-to-peer networking.
- Sensors: Incorporate device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) for interactive and dynamic chess experiences, such as tilting the phone to adjust the board's perspective.

## Research questions
1. How is chess played?
2. In what kind of "circles" is chess played? (think of friend vs friend, or stranger vs stranger in a park)
3. What features can I implement to improve the experience of users of all mastery levels?
4. How can I make it easier for people to pick up a random chess game? (lower the barrier for entry)

## Stakeholders

- Development Team (David and Dylan)
- Teachers (Mostly Erik/Ruud)
- People who enjoy playing chess (in varying degrees)

## Approach

I will probably single out 1 or 2 very promising technologies and use this as the main features of the app.
I want to use a hybrid approach where I create a M3 (Material 3) based design for android and a HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) based design for iOS. Where I will put a focus on the iOS design if there is any shortage of time.

## Do's

- Prioritise user-friendliness and accessibility in UX
- Create a balance between features for users of different experience levels.
- Lower the barrier of entry for playing a chess game.

## Don't's

- Keep it simple, don't make too many features
- Ensure the app enhances the chess experience rather than replacing it entirely.
- Hardware usage should be seamless, prevent bloat in the UX.
