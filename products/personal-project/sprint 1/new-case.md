## Problem definition

Learning chess can be intimidating if you have to find most information online yourself or take lessons.
How can we design a mobile app that will help a beginner learn the strategy of chess in 20 matches against a bot (or consenting player)
and as a result lift their elo from 1000 to 1200.

## Research Questions

1. What different strategies does a beginner need to learn to be able to increase their elo from 1000 to 1200
	+ Criteria: List atleast 5 different strategies that combined form the needed 200 elo increase. Increase the amount of strategies if the desired increase is not reached.
	
	Library + Field

2. In what different ways can we learn the player these different strategies?
	+ Criteria: Identify techniques that help atleast 85% of the players.
	
	Field or Library -> Workshop -> Lab

3. Identify the different problems with allowing assistance in chess matches against other players.
	+ Criteria: List atleast 5 problems and compare them based on user experience and impact on player ranking.
	
	Field -> Workshop -> Showroom

4. How can we prevent the help that the app provides from becoming intrusive?
	+ Criteria: The amount of users that should find the help intrusive should be lower than 10% after playing 1 game.
	
	Field -> Workshop -> Lab
