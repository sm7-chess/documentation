# Chess App Sprint 1 Analysis

## Early Project Concept

A chess app that is connected to David's S6 project. The aim of the project is to improve the experience of the App with features that try to focus on several hardware features only mobile devices have. This will all be conceived by the Design thinking process, which will allow me to create this app in an iterative way.

## Stakeholders

- Developers (David & Dylan)
- Teachers (David's side and Dylan's side with a focus on Dylan's side)
- People who like to play chess

## Base Features

To make sure my project is fully compatible with David's project, I will need to incorporate a few features to make that possible:

- Login that is equivalent to David's login system
- Play chess games against bots or other users (Online only)
- Add/Remove users as friends (Optional)

## Potential Technologies

- Wifi/Bluetooth for finding nearby players (to play a game or befriend in the application)
- Detecting shake for resetting the chess board after a game (or with dialog during one)
- Use Camera to detect physical chess board
