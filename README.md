### Notes

All direct links to documents are tagged in the git repository to ensure "snapshots". I will make one of these for every assessment.

### Products

- [Case Document](https://github.com/sm7-chess/documentation/blob/first-assessment/products/personal-project/sprint%201/case.md#problem-definition)
- [Analyis Document](https://github.com/sm7-chess/documentation/blob/first-assessment/products/personal-project/sprint%201/analysis.md#early-project-concept)
- [Usability Workshop](https://github.com/sm7-chess/documentation/blob/first-assessment/products/personal-project/workshops/usability/monitor-osd.md#problem)

### Estimation

Orienting: I have created a case which I think is of better value than what is in the Analysis document, I have clearly laid out research questions and goals which will allow me to have a clear vision of what this project needs. With the Usability workshop I sadly didn't make it to the Testing phase.
